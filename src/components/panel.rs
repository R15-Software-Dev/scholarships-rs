/// A panel for use in visual separation of a group of components. A `Panel` arranges
/// a series of elements within a shaded rectangle using the flexbox column layout.
///
/// It takes a series of children. Usually these would be in the form of a `Row` element,
/// which will arrange its own children in a row within the panel, however it can be any
/// HTML element.
///
/// Example:
/// ```
/// view! {
///     <Panel>
///         <Row>
///             <OutlinedTextField
///                 // ...
///             />
///             <CheckboxList
///                 // ...
///             />
///         </Row>
///     </Panel>
/// }
/// ```
